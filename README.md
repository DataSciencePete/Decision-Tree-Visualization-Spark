# Decision Tree Visualization for Apache Spark and Apache Zeppelin
## Getting Started
Apache Spark provides its users the ability to implement Decision Trees algorithms in a very efficient way, however the output seems to be not so friendly for non-technical users. So this project is an attempt to visualize Decision Trees using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), by parsing the nested conditional statements to a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format, and using it as dataset for display. 
## Languages & Technologies Used
+ Apache Spark
+ Python
+ HTML
+ JavaScript
+ D3.js
## Usage
This is my own implementation and it works great for me, so you are free to use it, modify it, and create magic with it!
